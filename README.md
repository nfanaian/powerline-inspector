Mini PHP Web Framework with a built in JSON RESTful API designed around the Model-View-Controller pattern

I was tasked to build a JSON RESTful API web service for Senior Design.
Instead of utilizing modern web frameworks, I built a bare-bones framework from scratch to aid my understanding of web frameworks.

These bare-bones features include URL ReWrite through use of .htaccess, in order to use the URL to filter website requests.
This is where the Model-View-Controller design aids in routing the user depending upon their request.
Typical requests: HTTP://siteurl.com/<Controller>/<Action>/<Params...>/
