Front End to Project Dragon

index8.html

Updated map Interface page and seperated Styling and Javascript to seperate pages.

Currently every feature needed for demo is implemented except for update AJAX call.(Just need to ask Navid what "func" is).

Will update "Awaiting image" picture size to match collected images and edit submit button styling before demo.

Later, I'll need to redo the image zoom(modal) and edit the filter. Then I'll start working on Login page with Navid.
