# utility_inspection
Front End to Project Dragon

(NOTE: Blue Filter on MapView2.html will not look correct until navbar.html is added to map page)

The pages have been edited. I have added the time filters for both the map and table pages. I also changed the look of both pages to support previous comments as discussed in our last meeting.

Once a plan for comments has been figured out and implemented, the only things left are:
	Change "Awaiting Image" picture
	Test Upload Files
	Minor styling updates
